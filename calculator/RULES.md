# Calculator Requirements

* `Basic Operations`: The calculator should be able to perform basic
  arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,
  and division.

* `User Input`: The calculator should be able to accept user input for
  the numbers and the operation to be performed. You can make the input
  system simple (like entering two numbers and an operator
  consecutively) or more complex (like allowing the user to enter the
  whole equation).

* `Error Handling`: The calculator should be able to handle common error
  situations gracefully. For example, it should prevent division by zero
  and handle non-numeric input correctly.

* `Data Validation`: The calculator should validate the user's input and
  ensure that it's within the acceptable range. For example, if the user
  enters a letter when a number is expected, the calculator should
  prompt the user to correct their input.

* `Continuous Calculation`: Allow the user to perform calculations
  continuously, using the result of the previous operation in a new
  calculation.

* `Function Implementation`: Implement each operation as a separate
  function. This will give you practice with defining and calling
  functions in Rust.

* `Testing`: Include tests to ensure your calculator functions as
  expected. This can help you get familiar with Rust's testing
  framework.

* `User Interface`: Depending on your comfort level and the challenge
  you want to take on, you could even create a basic text-based or
  terminal-based user interface for the calculator.
