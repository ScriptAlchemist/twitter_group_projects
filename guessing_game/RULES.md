# Guessing Game Requirements

* `Number Generation`: The program should generate a random number between 1
and 100 at the start of the game.

* `User Input`: The program should prompt the user to enter a number.

* `Input Validation`: The program should validate that the user's input is a
number. If the input is invalid, the program should prompt the user to
enter a number again.

* `Comparison`: The program should compare the user's guess to the generated
number. It should tell the user if their guess is too high, too low, or
correct.

* `Game Loop`: The program should repeat the guessing process until the user
guesses the correct number. Once the correct number is guessed, the
program should congratulate the user and stop.

* `Guess Limit`: (Optional) You can add a limit to the number of guesses a
user can make. If the user doesn't guess the number within the limit,
the game ends.

* `Difficulty Levels`: (Optional) You can add different difficulty levels to
the game. For example, on an easy level, the number to guess could be
between 1 and 50, while on a hard level, it could be between 1 and 1000.
