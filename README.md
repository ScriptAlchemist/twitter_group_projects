# Basic To Advanced Projects To Learn About Different Languages

Each project will have individual folders with

* [Guessing Game](./guessing_game/RULES.md): This is a slightly more advanced project that will
introduce you to basic concepts like variable declaration, user input,
conditionals, and loops.

* `Basic Calculator`: This project will give you practice with functions,
error handling, and more complex conditionals.

* `Command Line Todo List`: This project will introduce you to file I/O and
serialization/deserialization with formats like JSON. You'll learn to
read from and write to files, as well as manage state in a small
application.

* `Simple HTTP Server`: This will introduce you to networking in Rust, as
well as the basics of the HTTP protocol. It's also a good introduction
to error handling in Rust.

* `Web Scraper`: This project will introduce you to more advanced topics
like regular expressions and HTML parsing. It's also a good way to learn
about handling complex data structures in Rust.

* `REST API Client`: This project will teach you about making HTTP requests,
handling JSON data, and interacting with APIs.

* `Multi-threaded File Downloader`: This project will introduce you to
concurrency in Rust. You'll learn about threads and how to manage shared
resources between them.

* `Chat Server using Tokio`: This project will introduce you to asynchronous
programming in Rust using the Tokio runtime. You'll learn about
async/await, Futures, and how to manage asynchronous I/O.

* `Web Server using Hyper and Tokio`: This project will build on your
previous knowledge of HTTP and async I/O to create a more complex,
asynchronous web server.
